# Generative AI for Social Network Analysis without Coding

**Part of the NUSC Summer School in Network and Data Science**  
📍 University of Greenwich | 📅 12 June 2025 | 🧑‍🏫 Instructor: Dr Guido Conaldi

This full-day course introduces participants to the use of Generative AI tools for conducting Social Network Analysis (SNA) without the need to write code. It is designed for social scientists and researchers who wish to explore and visualise network data using accessible, AI-supported workflows.

## Course Objectives
By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
- Use AI tools to clean and transform relational data.
- Generate and interpret key network metrics (e.g. degree, betweenness).
- Identify communities and cohesive subgroups.
- Produce high-quality network visualisations.
- Critically assess AI-generated outputs and their limitations.

## Requirements
- Laptop with internet access.
- No coding experience required.
- Some familiarity with basic SNA concepts is helpful but not essential.

## Contents
- Introduction to SNA concepts
- AI-powered workflows using tools like ChatGPT and Hugging Face
- Visualising networks with AI-guided platforms
- Use cases and discussion
